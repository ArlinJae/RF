## Overview
I've decided to teach myself the basics of Radio Communication over a ~weekend~ (it was originally meant to be a weekend but I decided I wanted to spend a bit more time doing it) and this mainly serves as a repository of what were pretty good learning resources for me. 

My notes are slightly repetitive of the original content but I've written them so that they are easy to skim. 

The current lay of the land is that these notes are sorted by the resource they're made from, but what I would like to do once I'm done going through all the sources is to make a list of 'master' notes (ie. cross-resource notes which accompass everything I've learnt). 

I don't think these things are worth memorizing but I do think these set of notes are worth going over a few times to develop familiarity with the content. One thing which I'm realising as I go along with these courses is that it makes a ton of sense to grab a simulator and play around with it (especially the E&M stuff). 

I'm currently using the [issues](https://github.com/ArlinJae/RF/issues) page as a dumping ground of the links I'm coming across. If and when I use them to study, I will add them to the master resource list. 

## Resources

### Resource Overview
While doing this learning, I would try and optimize for an understanding of a few broad areas. 

1. Basics of RF
2. Antenna/ System Design
3. Digital Signals Processing
4. GNU Radio (+ Unix python/ cpp)

### Learning Resources

- `-` Represents to-do
- `+` Represents covered
- `!` Represents doing

The order in which I'm mentioning these are the orders in which I'm planning on going through these.
