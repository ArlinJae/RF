# GNSS Systems

## Overview
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a general term describing any satellite constellation that provides positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services on a global or regional basis.

## Key GNSS Systems
1. **GPS (Global Positioning System)** - United States
2. **GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System)** - Russia
3. **Galileo** - European Union
4. **BeiDou** - China
5. **NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation)** - India
6. **QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System)** - Japan

## Components of GNSS
- **Space Segment**: The satellites themselves.
- **Control Segment**: Ground stations monitoring and controlling the satellites.
- **User Segment**: GNSS receivers (e.g., smartphones, car navigation systems).

## How GNSS Works
1. **Signal Transmission**: Satellites transmit signals.
2. **Signal Reception**: GNSS receivers capture the signals.
3. **Triangulation**: Receiver calculates position using signals from at least four satellites.
4. **Timing**: Accurate clocks in satellites and receivers ensure precise timing.

## Applications

- Geolocation services (e.g., mapping, surveying)
- Timing (e.g., telecommunications, power grid synchronization)

## Accuracy Factors

   - Sampling rate
   - Resolution

4. **Signal Processing Unit**: Processes the digital signal to extract useful information.
   - **Acquisition**: Identifies visible satellites and their signals.
   - **Tracking**: Continuously follows the satellite signals.
   - **Demodulation**: Extracts navigation data from the signals.

5. **Navigation Processor**: Computes position, velocity, and time.

   - Position solution using triangulation
   - Error correction

## Signal Processing Steps
1. **Acquisition**: Detect and lock onto satellite signals.
